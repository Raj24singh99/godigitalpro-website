The right choice depends on your budget, your stage of growth, the skills you need, and how fast you want to move."

    paragraphs: [
      "Costs of hiring a digital marketing agency: Monthly retainer (fixed fee for ongoing services, e.g., ₹50k, ₹1L, ₹2L+ per month, depending on scope and region); Performance or project fees (sometimes) for big campaigns, special projects, or performance bonuses; Ad spend paid directly to platforms like Google, Meta, LinkedIn, separate from the agency fee.",
      "What you do not pay: Individual salaries of marketers, designers, analysts; Hiring and recruitment costs; Employee benefits and HR overhead. For small and mid-sized businesses, a good agency often gives better value than trying to hire all these roles individually.",
      "Costs of building an in-house marketing team: Salaries (Marketing Manager / Head of Growth; Performance Marketer; Content Writer / SEO Specialist; Designer / Social Media Manager); Hiring and recruitment time and money; Tools and software (SEO tools, email tools, ad management, analytics, design tools); Training and upskilling (courses, conferences, workshops); Overheads (office space if offline, hardware, benefits). Even a small in-house team (2–3 good people) can cost much more per month than a typical agency retainer, especially in mature markets."

    paragraphs: [
      "Control with a digital marketing agency: You control business goals and budget, final approval on messaging and creatives, overall direction (what to prioritize, what not to do). Agency controls day-to-day execution, technical details of campaigns, testing and optimization. Pros: less time micromanaging, benefit from their processes. Cons: you may feel a little far from the day-to-day if communication is weak. Fix with clear reporting, regular check-ins, and access to ad accounts and analytics (never give that up).",
      "Control with an in-house team: You own strategy, execution, tools/data, and daily priorities. Pros: high alignment with brand voice and culture; instant communication; easier coordination with sales/product/support. Cons: small teams overload quickly; missing skills can hurt performance; you must spend time on management and direction. In short: in-house = more control and more management. Agency = less control and less management (if you choose a good partner)."

    summary: "This is the most important point: “Who will actually bring better leads, sales, and growth?”",
    paragraphs: [
      "Performance with a digital marketing agency: Strong agencies are performance-driven. They bring experience from many accounts and industries, knowledge of what is working right now, and tested playbooks for ad structures, landing pages, and optimization. They can quickly spot mistakes, suggest proven funnels/offers, and run structured experiments. Performance depends on how open you are to recommendations, how well they understand your business, and quality of communication/feedback.",
      "Performance with an in-house team: Can be great when you have clear target audience and product-market fit, are ready to invest in talent and tools, and when marketing is central to the company strategy. Benefits: deep product understanding, close link with sales/product, fast feedback loops. Risks: wrong hires hurt performance; less exposure to varied tactics; key-person risk if someone leaves.",
      "So who wins? Honest answer: it depends on execution. A strong agency beats a weak in-house team. A strong in-house team beats a weak agency. For many small and mid-sized brands, best performance often comes from agency-led campaigns plus 1–2 in-house people for brand context and fast approvals—that’s the hybrid model."

      "In-house: Marketing Manager or Founder / Growth Lead responsible for vision, brand, offers, approvals, and internal alignment.",
      "Agency (e.g., GoDigitalPro): Handles performance marketing, SEO, content, and analytics; brings frameworks, specialized skills, and ongoing optimization.",
      "Benefits: You keep strategic control in-house; you plug into a ready-made team for execution; you can scale agency work up or down faster than hiring or firing employees. Works well for D2C brands, SaaS/B2B, and local services growing into regional or national brands."
